## Mochi Journeys

This repository was created to track mochi journeys that I have undertaken. Currrently I am using it to track the journey I am currently on which is 26 minutes of Javascript a day. I am hopin that at the end of this two month journey, I will have developed enough skills to be useful in developing apps using DAOhaus tools.

I would like my next journey to be solidity or perhaps continue with advancing javascript concepts.

I will use this repository to also collect resources that I use in each journey.
