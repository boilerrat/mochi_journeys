## Day 0

### Motivation

My goal on this journey is to spend 26 minutes a day (minimum) to learn javascript. My motivation for this is to build cool shit. Right now in Web3 there is a push towards modular tools. On the backend is solidity (probably my second journey). On the front end is java script.
DAOhaus has recently completed V3 which, out of the box is a bare bones DAO appplication. The power though is when you use the javascript libraries they have created in order to build custom apps, which I need to learn how to do because I have a million ideas and they won't get realized unless I figure it out for myself.

### How I intend to complete The Journey

- First of all, I am breaking my first rule already, which is to go to bed early and get up early to get my 26 minutes in. If I leave it to the evening I am often tired and the material does not sink in as well. I already go to bed way too late anyway so already a second benefit of this journey has arisen, which is to get more sleep.
- I will keep my learning organized and follow a curriculum. I intend to follow the curriculm called '30 Days of Javascript' located [here](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript). Understanding of course that this curriculum will take me longer thasn 30 days and will likely require the full 80 days to go though it at the correct pace.
- I will also venture out to other sources of learning, certainly youtube will be helpful or other related rabbit hole. That will be kept to a minimum as the main learning will be from the curriculm
- I will also make sure to do my daily check-ins with the mochi bot and attend whatever meetups my team plans.
- I will us this github file to track what I learn about each day and to store any other material I gather that will be helpful in my journey.

#### What are you working on next day?

I'd like to get the exercises done that I'm working on and then move onto the Day 4 exercises. I think it is important for me to be thorough and make sure I am doing all the exercises and also understanding them.

##### Anything to say about it?

#### What are you working on next day?

I havce a feeling I may rush through this little section of maths, Might try it again later. I think math will be a weak point though, so maybe I should spend some more time on it
